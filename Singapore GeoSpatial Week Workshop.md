**Highway classification**
**Roads are added with the tag highway=***

- **Residential roads highway=residential -** [**http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dresidential**](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dresidential)
- **Service roads highway=service -** [**http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dservice**](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dservice)

[Common values](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:wheelchair#Common_values)

**wheelchair=yes**
Wheelchairs have full unrestricted access. Use this tag to mark a feature in the United States as compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

- entry: stepless
- rooms: stepless

**wheelchair=limited**
Wheelchairs have partial access (e.g some areas can be accessed and others not, areas requiring assistance by someone pushing up a steep gradient).

- entry: has a step but not higher than 7 cm / 3 inch ('width of a hand')
- rooms: the most important rooms are stepless

**wheelchair=no**
Wheelchairs have no unrestricted access (e.g. stair only access).

- entry: has a step higher than 7 cm / 3 inch
- rooms: the important rooms are not accessible

**wheelchair=designated**
The way or area is designated or purpose built for wheelchairs (e.g. elevators designed for wheelchair access only). This is rarely used.
Note: **There is currently no default value** for wheelchair access. The **wheelchair**=no tag should be used to explicitly indicate a way is not accessible.


## Imagery to be used:
